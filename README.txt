I created two separate branches to ensure the files do not get mixed up. Here is a summary of each branch and the projects it contains.

-----------------
--- PROJECT 1 ---
-----------------

Project one is to recreate a previous assignment, but to turn it into a GUI application (if it was not before) and add new feature to it.
I chose to recreate our tip calculator as a full menu with options to split the bill and selecting a variety of items.
This menu uses tkinter and has appetizers, entrees, sides, drinks, and desserts. It also allows the user to input their name, and rejects
their order if they are missing information. You can choose to keep the bill whole, split into 2, 3, or 4. You also have the choice to tip
nothing, 10%, 15%, or 20%.

BRANCH NAME IS: project1

-----------------
--- PROJECT 2 ---
-----------------

Project two had more freedom to it, so I chose to create hangman. I created this using tkinter and included the game name, instructions,
an input box, submit button, new game button, and exit button. If you do not input a word, the games instructions will change to tell you
it is not a valid character and to pick a letter. It does the same for when you input anything that is not A-Z. When you input a incorrect
letter, it will tell you the letter is not in the word and will build the hang man. When you guess a correct word, it will tell you good job,
update the hidden word, and not build the hang man. There is also a functional guess counter that will go down with incorrect letters, but remain
the same when you input a correct letter. Once you guess the word, a command will disable the game preventing further input until the users clicks
NEW GAME. Clicking Exit will close the program.
